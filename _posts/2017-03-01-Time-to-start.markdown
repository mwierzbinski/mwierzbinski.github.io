<h1>Time to Start! </h1>

As this will be a very non technical and rather boring post I will try to make it quick. 

<h4>Who am I? and what's it all about? </h4>

Let's start with few words about me. I'm an ios developer, currently learning Swift and this blog is my way of sharing and cementing my acquired knowledge... Well that's at least what I would like to say. The truth is, since the blog was created approximately 2 months ago <i>~ekhm.. 3 months ago~</i> the only knowledge I gained is concerning the adventures of SG-1 team, Kenichi: The strongest Disicple, Gotham, Games of Thrones <i>~yeah.. I re-watched the whole thing~</i> and many, many more.

As you can presume because of my busy life, as described earlier, the only blog post visible here was the one that came with the [cayman template][cayman]. Suprisingly, I am not proud of it <i>~okey, maybe I'm a little proud. Watching all those tv series really takes time~</i>. Never the less... 

<h4> The promise </h4>

...That changes today! And yes, largely because I removed the template post and exchanged it with this one. However, not just because of that! Today I also promise to write at least one post every month. Not just some crappy "about me" post that brings nothing new to the community. I shall write real post, with real knowledge that real people can learn and improve from! And by real people, I mean mainly me!
<i>~Whoa this came out a bit pompus. Probably because I was listening to some epic music while writing...~</i>

<h4> That's all folks </h4>

There is not really much more to say. The promise was made! 

For all those non-belivers who want to type comments with sarcastic smiles saying: "Hey you really weaseled out yourself from this month's work with this short pice of pure awesomness writing", all I can say is: 
<i>Haha, There is no comment section yet so you can't send me your heatfull comments!</i>

For all others who are actually interested in what will happen here I can assuere you This post doesn't count as March's post so be patient, more is comming!

Clean code and reproduce ! 

ps It would be so lame if this would be only post I will ever write... -.-
